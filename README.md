# Crowdfunding-ETL
Independent Funding is a crowdfunding platform for funding independent projects or ventures. I will be moving all their accessible data from one large Excel file onto a PostgreSQL database.

The company has just received a new dataset that contains information about the backers who’ve pledged to the live projects. And, Independent Funding wants you and Britta to perform both an ETL process on this dataset and a data analysis by using SQL queries.

ou’ll use Python, Pandas, and Jupyter notebooks to do the extract and transform phases. Specifically, you’ll extract and transform the backers’ contact information from a CSV file to create a DataFrame that will be exported as a CSV file. You'll then do the load phase. Specifically, you’ll use the dataset to create an ERD and a table schema for creating a new table in the crowdfunding_db database. And, you’ll upload the CSV file that contains the backers’ information into this table. Finally, you’ll perform a data analysis on the crowdfunding_db database by using SQL queries.
